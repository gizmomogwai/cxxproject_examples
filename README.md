# Example usecases showing of cxx and cxxproject
The example project is used to install all available plugins locally
and show how cxx is used. It is a central point to see if the plugins
still work together with cxxproject and/or cxx.

# Releasing
Because this project collects all artefacts it is kind of an
integration test for all related cxx. It is only natural that the
release process is also done from this point.
